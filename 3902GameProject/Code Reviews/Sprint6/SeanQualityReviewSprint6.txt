Comments:
After running code analysis, it shows that no error, warning or message is generated from this class. On one way, it means that all 
variables and fields defined are used. And in the functions, all parameters are used. The class also does not have any 
superflous lines. Thus, the code has high cohesion. On the other way, it also has low coupling. Because no sign of dependency
on other modules was found.

Hypothetical Change:
Sicne the class has low coupling, the changes of other classes will have almost no impact on it, so the class is reusable.
