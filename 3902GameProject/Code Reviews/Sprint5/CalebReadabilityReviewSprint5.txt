Comments:
The file is fairly short, so there is not too much code as to make it unreadable. The variable names are easily understandable (ex: headsUpFont is the font
for the heads up display). Some of the lines of code in the sprite drawing are difficult to understand at first (ex: "new Vector2(camera.XPosition + 110, 10)"),
but it is clear that once magic numbers are refactored out, it will be easier to read (ex: "new Vector2(baseXPosition + pointXOffset, baseYPosition)"). Overall,
the code is readable, but should be refactored more to make the purpose of certain values more clear.
