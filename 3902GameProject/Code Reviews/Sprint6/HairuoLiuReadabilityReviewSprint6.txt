The code uses sensible names that follow c# naming convention as well as the the naming conventions 
we use in the other classes in the project. The “PortalSpriteFactory.Instance.CreateBluePortal” method 
is long but is not hard to understand how it works. And they follow c# convention and make sense to the reader. 
The List<IGameObject> temp is not so clear the meaning for it. Maybe name like List<IGameObject> collisionsTemp 
is better than only Temp;
