Comments:

The code has high quality. All variables defined are used. A problem of it may be the Update() function, because now it has no statement.
However, player movement is not required in this sprite, and the whole class is a prepared base for upcoming sprints. Thus, we do not 
need to add anything more in this sprint. Hence, the code has high cohesion.

Hypothetical Change:

(1) If we want to change the static background of the game, we just need to use another .png file. It means that we only have to load the 
file needed in content, and then replace the old file name ("background") with the name of new file in the code. 

(2) If we want the background to be updated with player`s movement, then both Draw() and Update() functions should be revised. The current
code cannot easily support this change.
