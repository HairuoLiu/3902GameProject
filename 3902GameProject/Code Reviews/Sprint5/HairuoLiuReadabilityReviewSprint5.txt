The code uses sensible names. 
This code follows C# capitalization convention strictly,
and there is no doubt that it has high readability. 
All of the lines of code in the sprite drawing are easy to understand. 
For example the "public void Enter()". 
Everyone know that is the enter function. 
There one small problem which is the value name "Psg". 
If there other people read the file and may not understand what this mean.
