The code uses sensible names that follow c# naming convention as well as the the naming conventions we use in the other classes in the project. 
For instance Coins and Points represent exactly what they are named after. The same is true for method names, they follow c# convention 
and make sense to the reader. Over all the code is very easy to follow and understand for someone new to the project. This biggest problem is honestly
the use of magic numbers which will be changed during refactoring. It also uses some hardcoded strings whihc will be problamatic when making 
other levels.
