Comments:
I think he did a good job on code quality part. All the variables defined are used.
For example the name of the Texture2D is "itemSpriteSheet" which is camel and for class such as "ItemSpriteFactory()" which is pascal. 
Also the other function like "CreateCoin()", "CreateBigMushroom()","CreateStar()".
All in all, all the code appears to be clean and well.


Hypothetical Change
If we want to change and create more items. 
One thing may need improves which is the return value. 
For all "Interfaces.IItem" Create function.
We can use some way instead of return the fuction like "return new FireFlower(x, y, itemSpriteSheet);",
but use the "itemCreate = new FireFlower(x, y, itemSpriteSheet)" and "return itemCreate".
