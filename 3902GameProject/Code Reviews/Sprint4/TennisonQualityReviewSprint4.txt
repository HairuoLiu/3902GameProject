Specific Comments on Code Quality:

The code appears to be clean and well written. There are not many superflous lines, are unneeding variabales.
The initial problem I first viewed when reviewing this and when infact trying to use it and th einterface it uses, 
it must include the dampen method. Which makes sense for the mario movement but makes less sense for items and other 
classes that would also like to use the physics interface and or this class.

Hypothetical Change:

I would change this then so as to not have the interface have the methods for dampen speed and variables that items 
and enemies would not need so as to allow them to inherit from this interface and still benifit from using a physics 
class and allowing for cleaner code. Right now we handle he physics of all things differently. Ie. Items have their 
own, enemies have their own, and mario has this. By making the interface less restricting and allowing other classes 
to use it easily it would unify the way physics works and would allow for cleaner easier to follow, higher quality code.
