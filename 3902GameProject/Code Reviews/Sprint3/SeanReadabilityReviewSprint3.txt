Comments:

The code has high readability. The author wrote the code by following C# capitalization convention. 
First, this file has many the variable names, and all of them are in camelCase, like levelName and itemType. 
Secondly, the file also has so many classes. And PascalCase is used for their names, for instance, BlockClass and 
ItemClass. The naming is simple and easy for users to distinguish different classes. 
Finally, there is no typos in the whole file, also there is no mistake like using "_" for private memebers. 
In addition, although the class has plenty of variables and classes, it is still straightforward to recognize 
specific object. 
In my opnion, no change is needed.
