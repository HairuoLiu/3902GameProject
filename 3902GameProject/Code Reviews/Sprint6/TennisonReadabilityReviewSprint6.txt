The code uses sensible names that follow c# naming convention as well as the the naming conventions we use in the other classes in the project. 
For instance Frames and total frames represent exactly what they are named after. The same is true for method names, they follow c# convention 
and make sense to the reader. Over all the code is very easy to follow and understand for someone new to the project. This class follows the convention 
and style of our other Generic____.cs classes and thus is even easier for the group memebers to follow.
