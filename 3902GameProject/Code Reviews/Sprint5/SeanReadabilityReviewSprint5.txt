Comments:

The code follows C# capitalization convention strictly, so there is no doubt that it has high readability. 
At first, all variable names in the file are in camelCase, like the boolean variable muted. 
Secondly, class and class member names are in PascalCase, such as PlaySoundEffect. And it is easy for users to understand the functions. 
At last, there is no typos and mistakes like using "_" for private memebers. 
What`s more, the class is straightforward for people to read.
In my opnion, there is almost nothing need to be changed in future.
