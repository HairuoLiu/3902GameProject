Comments:
After running code analysis, it shows that no error, warning or message is generated from this class. Also it does not have 
any superflous lines. Thus, all variables and fields defined are used. And in the functions, all parameters are used. 
Therefore, the code has high cohesion. In addition, it also has low coupling. Because I have not found any sign of 
dependency on other modules. This class once had warnings like CA1026, but it has been fixed latter.

Hypothetical Change:
The class is totally reusable now. However, there are some code, fields and methods not used now, like ToggleMute(). They 
will be improved in Sprint 6, to make the player control the volume, but all requirements in Sprint 5 are met now.
