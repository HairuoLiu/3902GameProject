Comments:

The code is clear enough for me to read. Because it strictly follows C# capitalization convention. 
First, camelCase is used for the variable names and class members, such as spriteSheetImageWidth. 
Secondly, PascalCase is also used for the other names, for instance, WorldBackground. 
Finally, there is no mistake like using "_" for private memebers. 
In addition, all the names are meaningful. 
In my opnion, no change is needed.
