Comments:

All contents of the code follow C# capitalization convention, which makes the high readability of it. 
Firstly, all variable names are in camelCase, like the int variable menuWidthBase. 
Secondly, class and class member names are in PascalCase, such as MainMenu, so users can easily understand the 
functions. 
Finally, there is no typos or mistakes like using "_" for private memebers. 
In conclusion, the class is straightforward for users to read, and nothiing needs to be changed.
