Specific Comments on Code Quality:

The code appears to be clean and well written. There are no superflous lines, are unneeding vairbales.
The initial problem I first viewed when reviewing this code was the use of fields instead of properties. 
But that has been fixed with the refactoring that Group 2 did. Over all the quality appears very high.

Hypothetical Change:

Let us say we no longer are using Mario as the only sprite a player can be and now the player can 
choose what sprite they want to be. How would this handle it? Well apart from a needed name change this 
generic class could be used by any sprite. When creating it you would just want to load it with the new 
spritesheet such that it would now handle the new character. This would then be followed by a name change 
to genericPlayerSprite is the coders wanted. Though one could still keep all the sprites seperated. 
The code would handle both.
