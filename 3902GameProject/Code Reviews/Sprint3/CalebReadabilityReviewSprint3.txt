Comments:
StarMario is not always very readable. Some parts make sense and are readable, such as the majority of methods, which just call the corresponding method in decoratedMario.
However, other parts are harder to understand, such as why StarMario has properties like XPosition and YPosition that never get used. Overall, this class needs refactored, but
many of its issues in readability and simplicity stem from design issues with IMario, so that will also have to be refactored.
