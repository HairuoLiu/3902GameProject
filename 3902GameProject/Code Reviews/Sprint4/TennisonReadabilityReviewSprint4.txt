The code uses sensible names that follow c# naming convention as well as the the naming conventions we use in the other classes in the project. 
For instance XPosition and YPosition is the position of the object using this particular set of . The same is true for method names, they follow c# convention 
and make sense to the reader. Over all the code is very easy to follow and understand for someone new to the project. This biggest problem is when using this outside of the 
class in other classes, it adds a layer of coupling that could be unnecessary and can make for some very lengthy method chains. Many of the problems with this class however
fall on the fact that not every class implements it yet that needs to, classes such as generic item and enemies would benefit from this but need refactored first.
