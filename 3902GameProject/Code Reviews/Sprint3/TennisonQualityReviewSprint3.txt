Specific Comments on Code Quality:

The code appears to be clean and well written. There are not many superflous lines, are unneeding variabales.
The initial problem I first viewed when reviewing this was the commented out lines as well as some lines that seem repetitive such as the commented lines which
should be removed. But that has been fixed with the refactoring that Group 2 did. Over all the quality appears very high.

Hypothetical Change:

Let us say we no longer are using a mouse controller, then it would easy to remove this code and the game would be very
uneffected, now let us say we need to add more abilities to the mouse controller, such as button clicks and wheel toggles.
This would also not be difficult since it would just follow the other controllers and group 2 would be able to add features
just like they did with the other controllers. Needless to say, whatever the change to the game, the easability to change the
mouse controller will be incredibly high.
