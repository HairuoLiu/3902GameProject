Specific Comments on Code Quality:

The code appears to be clean and well written. There are not many superfluous lines.
The OrangeBall and the BlueBall in the first viewed when reviewing. Problem work for the future staff. 
So actually we did not use that. Also I find “foreach (IGameObject o in temp)” the o in may also make people hard to understand.
I think we need to change that.

Hypothetical Change:
Over all the code is very easy to follow and understand for someone new to the project.
Everything work well but there some really long method such as “Game1.GameInstance.GameLevel.StaticObjects.Add”,
 “Game1.GameInstance.GameLevel.MovingObjects.Remove”, “PortalSpriteFactory.Instance.CreateOrangePortal”. 
If we build the bigger game we should load game object so the we did not need to use the “Game1.GameInstance”. 
And if the “OrangeBall” and the “BlueBall” level build I think their will be more option like the ball hit the enemy. 
We can also add the clip and so on in the future.
