Comments:

I ran code analysis and there was no warning or error from this class: all variables and fields defined are used. Also, I found that all lines are useful in this sprint. At last, the code has high cohesion.

Hypothetical Change:
Right now we have a designed file, which has all objects appear at the right positions. But if we load from other available files, depending on the file contents, there can be 2 cases:
1. Some of the objects are not shown.
2. Objects are at different positions from current ones.
