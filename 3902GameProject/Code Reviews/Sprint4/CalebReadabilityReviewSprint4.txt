Comments:
GenericItem had XVelocity, YVelocity, etc. (movement variables). The variables are sensibly named (XVelocity is the x-component velocity). In the future,
we could change this to use an instance of the same physics class that mario uses, but the readability is good. The are a lot of fields though, and this
should probably be reduced in refactoring.
