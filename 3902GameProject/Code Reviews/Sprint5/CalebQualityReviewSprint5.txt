Specific Comments on Code Quality:

The code is of reasonably high quality. It is all very cohesive; it only deals with positioning and displaying the heads up display.
The only dependencies are on the Game1 class, the IMario interface, and the ICamera interface. This is a reasonably low amount of dependencies, but it could be
reduced so that the scorekeeper was passed in, instead of the whole mario.

Hypothetical Change:

In the event that we add multiplayer, we would need to refactor scoring out of the mario classes/interfaces and into the Game1 class. This would mean in the
HeadsUp code, changing the lines that get scorekeeper from mario, to get scorekeeper from the GameInstance. This would be a fairly easy change.
