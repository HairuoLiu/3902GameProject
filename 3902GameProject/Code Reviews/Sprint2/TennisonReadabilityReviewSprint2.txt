The code uses sensible names that follow c# naming convention as well as the the naming conventions we use in the other classes in the project. 
For instance drawWidth is used in all classes that require a width for a sprite. The same is true for method names, they follow c# convention and make sense
to the reader. Over all the code is very easy to follow and understand for someone new to the project. One very small change could be with the variable frame.
Changing the name to currFrame would make it more readable to a new person on the project as that frame is the current one being used.
