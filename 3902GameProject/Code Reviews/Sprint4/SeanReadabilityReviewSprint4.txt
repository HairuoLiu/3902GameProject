Comments:

The code follows C# capitalization convention well, so its readability is high. 
First, all variable names in the file are in camelCase, for example, position. 
Secondly, PascalCase is used for class and class member names, for instance, Transform and Zoom. The names are simple and 
easy for users to know their functions. 
Finally, there is no typos and mistakes like using "_" for private memebers. 
In addition, the class is straightforward for people to recognize.
In my opnion, somethings can be changed in future: right now there are many comments in the code, they will be improved and
added to the final code at the end of sprint 4.
