Specific Comments on Code Quality:

The code appears to be clean and well written. There are not many superflous lines, are unneeding variabales.
The initial problem I first viewed when reviewing this is that since it uses so many magic numbers it can be 
hard to read and follow since so many of the values are obtained from a utility class. However, this does mean 
the code is easy to modify value wise should the need arise.

Hypothetical Change:

Say we wanted to add more ways of modyfiying the score, such as a second player. Then we would need just a 
second copy of this class, since the way it is built it pulls its initial values from a utility file and then 
modifies them as need be. This means we could keep track of any number of players with ease. However, say we 
wanted to add more functionality, such as new items that added to your score, or ways that would detract. This 
can also be done very easily since the way methods are created in the class and the way score is modified are not hard at all.
