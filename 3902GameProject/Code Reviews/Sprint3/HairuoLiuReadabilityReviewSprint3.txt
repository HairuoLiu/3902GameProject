The code is easy understand and the names is follow c# naming convention.I think everyone can understand and follow the project. goombaInstance is the instance of the game when we need a walking goomba it will run.
Each function in the file like ChangeMovementToRight(), MakeDead() uses sensible names thich follow c# naming convention.
One small problem I think for the "public void ChangeMovementToLeft()" we already move left so we do not need that.
