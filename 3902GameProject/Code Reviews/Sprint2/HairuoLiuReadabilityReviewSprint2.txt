First,I can read code with virtually any convention, no problem. I think is also easy understand and follow if other people read the project. 
Next, the name of the code uses sensible names thich follow c# naming convention. 
Then, The name like CreateStar(), CreateFireFlower(),CreateCoin() are clear also the value name like itemSpriteSheet everyone can read it.
