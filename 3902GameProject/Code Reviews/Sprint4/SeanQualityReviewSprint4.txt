Comments:
There is absolutely no error in this class. In addition, I have run code analysis and there was no warning or message 
generated from this class. It is proved that all variables and fields defined are used. The functions also have all 
parameters useful. Therefore, the code has high cohesion.

Hypothetical Change:
If we make any change to the window size, then some values in the class (16*6 and 3100) also need to be updated.
