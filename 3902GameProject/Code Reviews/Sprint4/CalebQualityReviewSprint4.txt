Specific Comments on Code Quality:

The code is of high quality. The only major dependency is on the ItemInfo class, which is an auxillary class that stores information about the position/movement
of the item, so the code has relatively low coupiling. The code also deals strictly with items. In theory, the different aspects of the item could be refactored into
different classes, but they are so simple that I think it's okay to all have in one class and still have high cohesion.

Hypothetical Change:

It would be preferable to have all objects use the same class/interface for physics objects (instead of the item class having ItemInfo, mario having Object Physics,
enemies have no external class). To make this change for GenericItem would involve editing the lines which use ItemInfo to use some other class, and there are only
~6 such lines, so the change would not be very difficult to make.
