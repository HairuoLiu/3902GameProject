Comments:
The file is written to be very readable. The class name, field names, and nearly all of the method names are all easily understood (ex: marioInstance is 
the instance of mario assoiated with the state object) and follow the same naming conventions as the rest of the state classes.
The method names CrouchToIdleToJump() and JumpToIdleToCrouch() can take a moment to understand. For example, JumpToIdleToCrouch() starts with the word "Jump",
but makes mario crouch, generally speaking, which makes it take a second or two longer to read and understand. This is not a serious issue, but it may deserve
renaming (in all of the state classes/interfaces). Finally, all of the method bodies are one or two lines and are easy to read and follow.
