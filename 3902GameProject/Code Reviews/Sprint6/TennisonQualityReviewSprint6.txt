Specific Comments on Code Quality:

The code appears to be clean and well written. There are not many superflous lines, are unneeding variabales.
The initial problem I first viewed when reviewing this is that since it uses so many protected variables, if for any reason we would need
this information it would be a pain to access. Luckily we do not but if the game were to grow more this could pose a problem.

Hypothetical Change:

Say we wanted to add more decorators to the marth character such that they would need to access this values from marth as well, since they
are protected we could run into issues, this could be fixed however by expanded the interface for marth such that the decorators (super marth?)
would be able to access all needed values for any future changes.
